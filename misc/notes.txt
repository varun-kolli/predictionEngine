SAMDHA Mental Health Client Level Data
- client level information containing patient demographic and diagnoses from 2004 - 2020

Version 1: Basic Decision Tree
- Imported data and attempted a basic decision tree model
  Excluded unnecessary or skewing data columns
  Subset of 100,000 rows, year 2013, only three most common disorders

F1 weighted score of around 0.3

Version 2: Data cleaning + More Decision Trees
- Due to lack of categorical variables, null values, and overlapping rows, more cleanup needed to happen to improve performance
- Combined DETNLF and EMPLOY columns
  Made all relevant columns categorical
  Removed null values by three different methods;
  Replace null values with the mode of each column
  Replace null values with the distribution of that column
  Remove all rows with null values
  Ran three separate models (scores in powerpoint from last week)
  All years, three most common disorders, subset of 200,000
  Very good at predicting depression, very low at everything else

Version 3: revisions to models
Used SMOTE to balance the dataset
Used balanced dataset as training set, unbalanced for testing set
Slightly improved performance
